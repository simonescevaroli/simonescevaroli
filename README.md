### Hi there! I'm Simone 🚀

---

I'm currently a MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

In my profile you can find a lot of projects done during the universitary years. 🛠️

I'm actually interested in the software engineering field, but I have always had an eye on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence! 🤖

In general, my true passion in coding, I can't do without it! 👨‍💻
